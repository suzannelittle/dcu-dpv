**Due:** 24th September 2024 6pm

**Submission:** `202409-csc1158-skills-<username>` must be committed to gitlab.computing.dcu.ie before 6pm \- this version will be the one marked.

**Instructions:**&nbsp;

<!---->
1. fork [csc1158\-skills](https://gitlab.computing.dcu.ie/slittle/csc1158-skills) repository and rename to `202409-csc1158-skills-<username>` \(where \<username\> is your dcu username without the brackets\)

2. create a file `git.md` from `template.md` which has instructions about the required content

3. edit `README.md` to add your details \(e.g, change the name and add link to `git.md`\)

4. fill in your first skill report on the topic of git \(see `example.md` for an example\)

5. commit and push to gitlab.computing.dcu.ie \(with a sensible comment\) to gitlab.computing.dcu.ie before 6pm Sep 24th.

You will continue to use `202409-csc1158-skills-<username>` for your other 5 skill reports to be submitted for assignment 7 at the end of semester.

**Marking Criteria:** \(out of 9\)

<!---->
1. Properly forked and renamed the example repository \[2\]

2. Used correct git commands and have sensible commit comment \[2\]

3. 2025\-csc1158\-skills\-\<username\> correctly pushed to gitlab.computing.dcu.ie before deadline \[2\]

4. Skill report on git \[3\]

   1. Followed directions correctly and completed all sections \[1\]

   2. At least 1 “advanced” tip \[1\]

   3. Includes a correct example \[1\]

**Plagiarism and excessive collaboration:**&nbsp;

While it’s natural that some of the skills reflection might be similar, I don’t expect that people will have the same three tips or example usage. Each skill report is an individual document based on what **you’ve** learned about the technology, what **you** think is either interesting or important and how **you** rate your skill.
